Currently cleaning up the UI package

Done
[x] 'tools' now modes

Still to do
[ ] Properties dialog
[ ] Dynamic module system
[ ] Cleanup frame
[ ] PogPanel - move to module?
[ ] PogWindow - tabbed pane - Find a name for that.  It is the docked window on the left side (default).  Might change to an 'outlook'-style bar in later version, so tabbed pane is not good.  Find a name based on function, not design
[ ] Grouping Dialog
[ ] Attribute dialog
[ ] Start documenting architecture
[ ] Re-extract language resources
[ ] Fix nomenclature
[ ] Check tagged 'TODO' and '@' notations
[ ] Consider using log4j as full-featured logging system (debug only, game logging is better served with a simpler system, I would suppose)
[ ] Turn 'random rotate' into module/plugin
[ ] Build menu as plugin
[ ] Build a legit pog library (can't verify most of these files' source - pretty certain they're not all public domain) 

Wish list
[ ] Configure tool bar
[ ] Configure keyboard shortcuts
