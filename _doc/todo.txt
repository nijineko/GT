Currently cleaning up the UI package

Still to do
[x] Line colors are not saved
[x] Properties dialog - grouping.  make pretty.  consider adding com.maziade source code directly to gametable  project (potential fork of my lib)
[ ] Dynamic module system
		[ ] Loading modules from module folder is in place, but we need configuration options (probably a config file at first - but whole set of UI later)
[ ] GametableFrame - Cleanup
[ ] MapElementTyleLibraryPanel - cleanup
[ ] PogWindow - tabbed pane - Find a name for that.  It is the docked window on the left side (default).  Might change to an 'outlook'-style bar in later version, so tabbed pane is not good.  Find a name based on function, not design
[ ] Grouping Dialog
[ ] Attribute dialog
[ ] Start documenting architecture
[ ] Re-extract language resources using java's ResourceBundle model (more flexible for plugins)
[ ] Fix nomenclature (pogs are now MapElements - a pog is now a layer of map elements representing characters)
[ ] Check tagged 'TODO' and '@' notations
	[ ] Document notation syntax
[ ] Turn 'random rotate' into module/plugin
[ ] Build menu as plugin
[ ] Build a legit pog/map elements library (can't verify most of these files' source - pretty certain they're not all public domain) 
[ ] Other toolbar elements as plugins
[ ] UI Mode as plugins
[ ] LineSegments could be shapes and areas (or a more versatile component to allow for advanced drawing plugins)
[ ] Normalizing plugin names and making them static (instead of dynamically linking it to full class name, which will break on refactoring)
[ ] Split core plugins source code from non-core plugins source code

Wish list
[ ] Configure tool bar
[ ] Configure keyboard shortcuts
[ ] Export functionality for v2.0 (so maps could be imported in 3.0)
[ ] Use the media wiki as gametable's main page? (interesting setup for a wiki: http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Main_Page  )
[ ] Consider using log4j as full-featured logging system (debug only, game logging is probably better served with the simpler logging system)

Some modules that could be developped
[ ] HTTP-based network protocol + server
[ ] Custom pog libraries (procedural textures, etc)
[ ] User-defined layers (instead of pogs, enviroment, overlay, underlay)
[ ] Special layers (we could have a layer for walls, using procedural textures)
 
 
Roadmap ?
[ ] Support of UndoableEdit interface 
[ ] Actions could also be accessible through a menu and configured as buttons, keyboard shortcuts or other accessible means by the user
 
Done
[x] 'tools' now modes
